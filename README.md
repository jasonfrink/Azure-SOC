<h1>Microsoft Azure SOC Home Lab</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

This project walk-through details the setup of a personal Security Operations Center (SOC) using Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Sentinel as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) solution. With this setup, I created a simulated environment to monitor, log, and alert on potential security events across a virtual machine and connected resources. This hands-on project is ideal for cybersecurity professionals looking to gain experience with threat detection, log analysis, and incident response, all within a cost-effective, cloud-based setup. Through this lab, I configured alerts, implemented threat intelligence feeds, and enabled real-time monitoring. This project provides a foundational experience in building and managing a SOC environment, using tools and processes similar to those deployed in real-world enterprise security setups.
